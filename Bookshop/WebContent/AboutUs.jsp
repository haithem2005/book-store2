					Book Shop was founded in December 2019 by 5 enthusiastic developers:
					Worod Tahmaz, Deepthy Nair, Avani Agrawal, Haithem Elhessawy and
					Mariana Serna in a cozy town named Lund located at the south of
					Sweden. </br> </br> Our selection of more than 20,000 titles ranges from the
					classics of world literature to the cutting edge of contemporary
					fiction and poetry, not forgetting a copious display of history,
					politics, philosophy, cookery, essays and children’s books. And our
					lovely online shop, provides the perfect setting in which to
					explore them all. </br> </br> Our aim has always been to represent on our
					catalogue the distinctive ethos of the Review – intelligent without
					being pompous; engaged without being partisan. If you aren’t able
					to visit us in person, we hope our website will give you a flavour
					of what makes the shop unique. If you are able to join us in Bury
					Place, we look forward to finding you the books you know you need,
					and more importantly, the ones you didn’t know you needed. </br>
